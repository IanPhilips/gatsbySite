Since then, many things have changed, but one has stayed the same: the need for decentralized governance to advance humankind with liberating technology.</p>\n<p>Since launching on mainnet in 2018, Aragon has managed to become the leading DAO platform, with more than $300M in AUM.</p>\n<p>Foreseeing the future is always hard when the technology is evolving so much, which is the case with Ethereum and the crypto space broadly.</p>\n<p>After the Aragon Network DAO launches in a few weeks, ANT holders will have power over the future of Aragon. With that, the roadmap outlined in the initial 2017 whitepaper will be complete. As founders, we want to make sure that Aragon is in its best position to face that new era. This is a sneak peek into what we would like to see as founders of the project.</p>\n<h2>Optimistic DAOs become the standard</h2>\n<p>Until a few weeks ago, DAO governance always faced the compromise between secure but expensive on-chain voting or non-binding but free polling.</p>\n<p>Our recent breakthrough pairing off-chain voting with on-chain execution defines a before and after moment in how we think about governance. It creates the possibility of bundling off-chain voting with optimistic execution â€” assuming a vote result is correct unless disputed in Aragon Court and proved otherwise. Therefore our recent bet in Snapshot, which will play a fundamental role in pushing DAO adoption.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, we will be unveiling a new minimalistic governance framework for optimistic DAOs that will serve as the base for Aragon 2.</p>\n<p>Because of this breakthrough, we will propose transitioning efforts from building an Aragon-specific chain to doubling down on off-chain scalability and having Aragon on other community chains, like Ethermint or xDai. This would allow us to have the bandwidth to focus on the Snapshot opportunity while supporting other communities like Ethermint or xDai.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 25, 2020","slug":"Thanksgiving","title":"We love Thanksgiving","photo":"/assets/wild_turkey_eastern_us.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"Thanksgiving"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
