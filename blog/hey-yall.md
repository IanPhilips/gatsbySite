A glimpse into the future of organizations that you can use today

Tao or Dao is a Chinese word signifying the "way", "path", or "road", or sometimes more loosely "doctrine", "principle" or "holistic beliefs".

We use female Spanish names for Aragon releases, inspired by the story of Maria. Apart from there being a Chinese word called dao (DAO) that means the way, there is also a female Spanish name that means the way: Camino.

That’s why Aragon 0.8 is called Camino. We are paving the way to deliver Aragon to the users that need it the most. Let’s go over what makes Aragon 0.8 Camino special.
