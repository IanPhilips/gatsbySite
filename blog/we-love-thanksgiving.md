We started working on Aragon four years ago. Since then, many things have changed, but one has stayed the same: the need for decentralized governance to advance humankind with liberating technology.

Since launching on mainnet in 2018, Aragon has managed to become the leading DAO platform, with more than $300M in AUM.

Foreseeing the future is always hard when the technology is evolving so much, which is the case with Ethereum and the crypto space broadly.

After the Aragon Network DAO launches in a few weeks, ANT holders will have power over the future of Aragon. With that, the roadmap outlined in the initial 2017 whitepaper will be complete. As founders, we want to make sure that Aragon is in its best position to face that new era. This is a sneak peek into what we would like to see as founders of the project.
